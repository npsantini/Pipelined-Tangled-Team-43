For 20191030 version:

On Linux, building should be as simple as typing "make" in this directory.

Note that AIK uses PCCTS, which is now a rather old maintenance release, so
it's included as source in the pccts directory here.  PCCTS is rebuilt as part
of the AIK make process.

AIK itself was written by Prof. Henry Dietz in support of the EE480 course in
the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
Kentucky, and is made freely available as Public Domain source code without
any use restrictions... nor any guarantees, nor does the author accept any
liability for any applications of AIK. For documentation and further
information, including a link to the CGI version online, see:
